# Task Backlog

4. **Dashboard Demo App** *(new)*  
   - Iterate on the new app.py experience (embedded feed, control sidebar, structured log).  
   - Parity goals: registration wizard, resolution/FPS controls, Jetson power logging switches, attendance export/clear, and guidance (leaving announcements/status in the legacy UI for now).  
   - Add preset profiles, scripted demo mode, fake camera sources, and the new overlay toggles for FPS/identity scores/metrics so the dashboard can serve as the main demo surface.
